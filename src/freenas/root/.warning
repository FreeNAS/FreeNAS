Warning: the only supported method of making changes to the TrueNAS
configuration is through the TrueNAS CLI or the TrueNAS REST and Websocket APIs.
Manual configuration changes through the system shell will not persist after
reboot and may not persist after service reload or restart. Altering the base
install of TrueNAS through installing new packages is also not supported and
may result in breaking the TrueNAS appliance.
