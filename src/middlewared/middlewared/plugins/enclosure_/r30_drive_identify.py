    Unfortunately, there is on way to query current drive identification status.
    Furthemore, switching SMBUS back into auto mode doesn't guarantee the LEDs
    will be automatically cleared so we need to clear them manually. Finally,
    it's unclear on whether or not we even need to transition from manual to auto
    mode (and vice versa) on SMBUS so we go the safe route and always toggle it.
    Steps are as follows:
        1. switch to manual mode
        2. clear drive IDENTIFY led `bay` on `ctrl`
        3. clear drive FAULT led `bay` on `ctrl`
        4. clear drive REBUILD led `bay` on `ctrl`

        If the user has requested anything other than CLEAR for the drive bay
            5. light up the drive bay that was requested

        6. switch back to auto mode
